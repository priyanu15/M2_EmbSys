# Abstract
I am creating a project on door sensor. So basically the working principle of this is that whenever the door is opened the LED is turned on without changing the state of the other pins.Automatic Door Opener Systems are very useful as you do not need a person to standby the door and open it whenever a guest comes. Also, since the doors are opened and closed only when a person approaches the door, there is significantly less loss of air conditioning.You might have seen Automatic Door Opener Systems at shopping malls, cinemas, hospitals etc. where, as soon as a person approaches the door (at about 2 or 3 feet), the door automatically slides open. And after some time (about 5 to 10 seconds), the door closes by sliding in the reverse direction.

# High Level Requirements
1. Home security,home surveillance,home management functions and communciation management functions.
2. Where is this door sensor will be used.
3. Number of frequecies of to and fro where the sensor has been placed
4. Security of the door sensor and how will it be processed
5. Time response of the sensor.
6. The range of the sensor where it can detect the motion.

# Low Level Requirements
1. The functions and other things depend on the choice of the consumer/customer.
2. The place where it will be used also depends on the customer and his/her choice.
3. There are variety of door sensors which are used for different purposes such as:-3.1 For security
4.                                                                                  3.2 For crowded places there are different door sensors(eg. airport, malls etc.)
5.                                                                                  3.3 For normal places (eg. Homes, Offices etc.)
6.  The time response and the range depends on the frequency and place where it is being used.
